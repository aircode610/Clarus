{"ids":"2020.acl-main.427","assertions":["We propose a semantic parsing dataset focused on instruction-driven communication with an agent in the game Minecraft.","The dataset consists of 7K human utterances and their corresponding parses.","Given proper world state, the parses can be interpreted and executed in game.","We report the performance of baseline models.","We analyze the successes and failures of baseline models."]}
{"ids":"2020.acl-main.606","assertions":["This paper is concerned with semantic parsing for English as a second language (ESL).","The paper is motivated by the theoretical emphasis on the learning challenges that occur at the syntax-semantics interface during second language acquisition.","The task is formulated based on the divergence between literal and intended meanings.","The approach combines the complementary strengths of English Resource Grammar, a linguistically-precise hand-crafted deep grammar, and TLE, an existing manually annotated ESL UD-TreeBank, with a novel reranking model.","Experiments demonstrate that in comparison to human annotations, the method can obtain a very promising SemBanking quality.","By means of the newly created corpus, state-of-the-art semantic parsing as well as grammatical error correction models are evaluated.","The evaluation profiles the performance of neural NLP techniques for handling ESL data.","The evaluation suggests some research directions."]}
{"ids":"2020.acl-main.608","assertions":["One daunting problem for semantic parsing is the scarcity of annotation.","Aiming to reduce nontrivial human labor, we propose a two-stage semantic parsing framework.","The first stage utilizes an unsupervised paraphrase model to convert an unlabeled natural language utterance into the canonical utterance.","The downstream naive semantic parser accepts the intermediate output and returns the target logical form.","The entire training process is split into two phases: pre-training and cycle learning.","Three tailored self-supervised tasks are introduced throughout training to activate the unsupervised paraphrase model.","Experimental results on benchmarks Overnight and GeoGranno demonstrate that our framework is effective and compatible with supervised training."]}
