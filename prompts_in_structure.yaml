          You are an expert at analyzing relationships between assertions in academic and analytical writing. 
          Evaluate the quality of the proposed relationship between these two assertions.
          
          Assertion 1: "{assertion1_content}"
          Assertion 2: "{assertion2_content}"
          Proposed Relationship Type: {relationship_type}
          
          Relationship Types:
          - evidence: One assertion provides evidence, examples, or support for another
          - background: One assertion provides context, setting, or foundational information for another
          - cause: One assertion directly causes or leads to another
          - contrast: Assertions present opposing viewpoints, contradictions, or different perspectives
          - condition: One assertion is a prerequisite or condition for another
          
          Rate this relationship on a scale of 0-100 and provide structured feedback.
          
          Be strict but fair in your evaluation. Consider:
          1. Logical coherence of the relationship
          2. Strength of the connection
          3. Clarity of the relationship type
          4. Whether the assertions actually relate in the proposed way
          
          Respond in this exact format:
          CONFIDENCE: [0-100]
          REASON: [One short sentence explaining why it's good or bad]
          SUGGESTION: [One of: "ADD", "MODIFY to [relationship_type]", "REMOVE"]
          
          Examples of good relationships:
          - Evidence: "AI can detect cancer" → "AI is useful in healthcare" (CONFIDENCE: 85-95, SUGGESTION: ADD)
          - Cause: "Increased CO2 levels" → "Global warming" (CONFIDENCE: 90-100, SUGGESTION: ADD)
          - Contrast: "AI will replace humans" vs "AI will augment humans" (CONFIDENCE: 80-95, SUGGESTION: ADD)
          
          Examples of relationships needing modification:
          - "AI algorithms improved" → "AI use in healthcare increased" (CONFIDENCE: 60-70, SUGGESTION: MODIFY to cause)
          - "Some studies show benefits" → "Technology is advancing" (CONFIDENCE: 40-60, SUGGESTION: MODIFY to evidence)
          
          Examples of poor relationships:
          - "It's sunny today" → "Technology is advancing" (CONFIDENCE: 0-20, SUGGESTION: REMOVE)
          - "Apples are red" vs "Oranges are orange" (CONFIDENCE: 10-30, SUGGESTION: REMOVE)

          You are an expert at analyzing rhetorical relationships between assertions using Rhetorical Structure Theory.
  
          Your task is to identify **{relationship_type}** relationships between the given assertions.
  
          {relationship_type_upper} RELATIONSHIPS:
          {rel_info_description}
  
          Examples: {rel_info_examples}
  
          CRITICAL RULES:
          - Only output relationships that fit the **{relationship_type}** pattern, even if subtle
          - Be thorough but precise: include only valid pairs
          - Each relationship must be between exactly 2 assertions
          - Provide confidence scores between 0 and 1
          - Give a short explanation of why the relationship exists
          - Consider temporal, causal, logical, and semantic connections
  
          OUTPUT FORMAT:
          Return ONLY a valid JSON array. Do not include any extra text.
  
          Each relationship object must contain:
          - assertion1_id: string
          - assertion2_id: string
          - relationship_type: "{relationship_type}"
          - confidence: float between 0 and 1
          - explanation: short string
  
          If no {relationship_type} relationships are found, return an empty array: []

          You are an expert at analyzing rhetorical relationships between assertions.
          
          You need to choose the BEST relationship type for a pair of assertions that could have multiple relationship types.
            
          Given these assertions and the possible relationship types, choose the ONE relationship type that best describes their relationship.
            
          Consider:
          1. Which relationship is most fundamental/primary?
          2. Which relationship best captures the semantic connection?
          3. Which relationship would be most useful for structuring a document?
            
          IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do not include any other text.
            
          Return your choice as JSON with these fields:
          - chosen_relationship: one of "evidence", "background", "cause", "contrast", "condition", or "contradiction"
          - confidence: number between 0 and 1
          - explanation: brief explanation of why this relationship type is best

          Assertion 1 (ID: {assertion1_id}): {assertion1_content}
          
          Assertion 2 (ID: {assertion2_id}): {assertion2_content}
            
          Possible relationship types:
          {possible_relationships}
            
          Choose the best relationship type for this pair.
